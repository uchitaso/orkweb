	* Oreka can now monitor multiple Network devices in parallel
	* Oreka can now replay tcpdump (pcap) network trace files
	* Improved RTP detection (Before: some RTP streams could go undetected)
	* Improved Cisco Skinny signalling management (Before: Sessions could break up spuriously and single session could be seen as two separate sessions)
	* Improved SIP detection (Before: SIP messages on some platforms went undetected)
	* Improved SIP signalling management (Before: Sessions could break up spuriously)
	* Oreka can now store in "pcmwav" format, ie, pcm stored in a wav file without compression
	* Sample rate can now be different than 8KHz across Oreka
	* Sample rate now tunable in SoundDevice plugin
	* Codecs can now be plugins

===========================================================================
2005-11-22 Oreka 0.3
