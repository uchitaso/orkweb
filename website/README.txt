1. INSTALLATION

   The Audacity web site requires PHP 4, and the PHP PEAR "HTTP" package
   (for content negotiation).

   "MultiViews" are required, so that "copyright.php" can be accessed as
   simply "copyright", for example.  On Apache servers, MultiViews will be
   turned on by the .htaccess file.  (This requires "AllowOverride Options" to
   be enabled in the server configuration.)

   Apache's mod_rewrite is required for automatic redirection of URLs from
   previous versions of the site.

3. LOCALIZATION

   Internationalization and localization are handled by PHP's gettext
   functions.  All PHP files use the UTF-8 encoding.  When editing these files,
   please configure your editor to use UTF-8.

   Localized pages are served automatically based on the Accept-Language header
   sent by the user's web browser.  Localized versions can also be accessed
   through links in the page footers.  (This method also sets a cookie so that
   future pages will be served in the same language.)

   To add a new translation:

   - Copy the translated po file to locale/X.po where "X" is the locale code.
   - Run "make" to compile the PO file.
   - Add a new item to the available_locales array in include/lang.inc.php.

   Note:  The "full locale name" must match one of the available locales on the
   web server.  Run "localedef --list-archive" for a list of locales.  On a
   Debian system, use /etc/locale.gen and "locale-gen" to add locales.

---------

4. UPDATING CONTENT

   When adding new content, be sure to pass all translatable strings through
   the _("gettext") function.  For example:
   
     <p><?=_("This sentence will be translated.")?></p>

   After adding or changing any translatable string, run "make" to update the
   message catalogs.  For significant changes, you may want to send the updated
   POT file to the translators before the change is published to the live web
   site, so that they have a chance to update the PO files first.

---------

5. UPLOADING CHANGES

   After checking your changes into CVS, run "cvs update && make" in
   "/home/groups/a/au/audacity/htdocs" on shell.sourceforge.net to update
   the live web site.

   For files that are not stored in CVS or generated by the Makefile, you can
   use scp or rsync to upload them to shell.sourceforge.net.

   You should run "umask 002" before modifying the audacity group directory on
   the sourceforge servers.  You may want to put this in your ~/.bashrc file
   (but be careful if you keep private files in your personal home directory).
