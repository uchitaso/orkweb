Building:

* Install Eclipse 3.1 or later
* Run Eclipse
* /File/Switch workspace/ -> select folder containing this file
* /File/import existing project into workspace/ -> select 1. orkbasej, 2. orktrack 3. orkweb
* /Window/open perspective/java
* Set the compiler compliance for the worskspace to Java 5 (Java 1.5)  /Window/preferences/ -> /java/compiler/
* Import user libraries:
	- Get the external java libraries pack from oreka.sourceforge.net and unzip it into {WORKSPACE}/lib
	- Edit oreka.userlibraries, search and replace the absolute path to jar files with your own.
	- /Window/preferences/ -> /java/buidpath/user libraries/ -> import -> select your modified oreka.userlibraries file
* At this point, all three projects should compile automatically without an error

Install required infrastructure software:

* Install Java 5 JDK
* Install Tomcat 5.5 or later, point it the the Java 5 JDK
* Copy all jar files from the external java libraries pack to {TOMCAT_HOME}/shared/lib
* Make note of the admin password
* Install MySQL or any database compatible with hibernate (there is a known problem with MySQL 5.0 - you need to change bit(1) to tinyint(1) for boolean columns - MySQL 4.x is OK)
* Create a database for storing oreka data
* Create a user/password for reading/writing the newly created database

Install orktrack:

* Create a folder for configuration and logging such as c:\oreka\orktrack
* Copy orkbasej/java/log4j.template.properties to this folder and change according to needs
* Copy orkbasej/java/mysql.hbm.template.xml to this folder and change according to needs
* Copy orktrack/orktrack.config.xml to this folder and change according to needs 
* Modify orktrack/WEB-INF/web.xml and make it point to those newly created config files
* Copy orktrack/deploy-template.xml to orktrack/deploy.xml and change deploy.xml according to your setup.
* Run deploy.xml as ant script (Right click/Run as). This should result in the following message:
	"[echo] OK - Deployed application at context path /orktrack"
* Point your browser to your Tomcat manager (e.g. http://localhost:8080/manager/html) 
	and check that orktrack has started, otherwise, check Tomcat logs


Install orkweb:

* Create a folder for configuration and logging such as c:\oreka\orkweb
* Copy orkbasej/java/log4j.template.properties to this folder and change according to needs
* Copy orkbasej/java/mysql.hbm.template.xml to this folder and change according to needs
* Modify orkweb/WEB-INF/web.xml and make it point to those newly created config files
* Copy orktrack/deploy-template.xml to orktrack/deploy.xml and change deploy.xml according to your setup.
* Run deploy.xml as ant script (Right click/Run as). This should result in the following message:
	"[echo] OK - Deployed application at context path /orktrack"
* Point your browser to your Tomcat manager (e.g. http://localhost:8080/manager/html) 
	and check that orkweb has started, otherwise, check Tomcat logs
* Point your browser to the newly deployed application (e.g. http://localhost:8080/orkweb/app)


Test orkweb:

* Edit orkbasej/java/net/sf/oreka/test/FillDatabase.java and point it to your own hibernate config file created earlier
* Run FillDatabase.java as a Java application. This will fill your oreka database with test data
* Point your browser to orkweb as described above
* Browse the test data
